# go-asterisk-config

Is a configuration manager for asterisk. It provides a simple JSON API for
reading and configuring asterisk configuration files.

This is intended to provide a full support for parsing asterisk configuration
files.

Asterisk configuration files are located in `/ect/asterisk`.This application is
a full implementation for managing that directory.
